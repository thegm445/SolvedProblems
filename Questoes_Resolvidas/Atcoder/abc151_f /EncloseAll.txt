Problem Statement

Given are N points (xi​,yi​) in a two-dimensional plane.

Find the minimum radius of a circle such that all the points are inside or on it.

Constraints

2≤N≤50
0≤xi​≤1000
0≤yi​≤1000

The given N points are all different.
The values in input are all integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N

x1​ y1​

:

xN​ yN​

Output

Print the minimum radius of a circle such that all the

N points are inside or on it.

Your output will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^−6.
