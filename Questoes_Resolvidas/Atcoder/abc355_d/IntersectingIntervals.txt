Intersecting Intervals 

Problem Statement

You are given N intervals of real numbers. The i-th (1≤i≤N) interval is [li​,ri​]. 
Find the number of pairs (i,j)(1≤i<j≤N) such that the i-th and j-th intervals intersect.

Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤ 5 * 10^5

0 ≤ li ​< ri ​≤ 10^9

All input values are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N

l1​ r1​

l2​ r2​

⋮

lN​ rN​

Output

Print the answer.

3 7

Sample Output 1

2

The given intervals are [1,5],[7,8],[3,7]. Among these, the 1-st and 3-rd intervals intersect, 
as well as the 2-nd and 3-rd intervals, so the answer is 2.
