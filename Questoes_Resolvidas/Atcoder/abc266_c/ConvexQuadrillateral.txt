Convex Quadrilateral

Problem Statement

Consider a two-dimensional coordinate plane, where the
x-axis is oriented to the right, and the y-axis is oriented upward.

In this plane, there is a quadrilateral without self-intersection.
The coordinates of the four vertices are
(Ax​,Ay​), (Bx​,By​), (Cx​,Cy​), and (Dx​,Dy​), in counter-clockwise order.

Determine whether this quadrilateral is convex.

Here, a quadrilateral is convex if and only if all four interior angles are less than 180 degrees.
Constraints

    −100 ≤ Ax ​, Ay ​, Bx ​, By ​, Cx ​, Cy ​, Dx ​, Dy ​≤ 100
    All values in input are integers.
    The given four points are the four vertices of a quadrilateral in counter-clockwise order.
    The quadrilateral formed by the given four points has no self-intersection and is non-degenerate. 
    That is:
        no two vertices are at the same coordinates;
        no three vertices are colinear; and
        no two edges that are not adjacent have a common point.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Ax​ Ay​
