Billiards

Problem Statement

Takahashi is playing billiards on a two-dimensional plane. The

x-axis functions as a wall; when a ball hits the axis, it will bounce 
off the axis so that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

Takahashi's ball is now at (Sx​,Sy​). When he strikes the ball aiming for some
point, it will roll in a straight line towards that point.

To make the ball hit the x-axis exactly once and then pass (Gx​,Gy​), 
where along the x-axis should he aim for?


Constraints

−10^6≤ Sx ​, Gx ​≤ 10^6
0 < Sy​ , Gy ​≤ 10^6
Sx​ != Gx​

All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Sx​ Sy​ Gx​ Gy​

Output

Let (x,0) be the point Takahashi should aim for. Print x.

Your output will be considered correct when its absolute or relative 
error from our answer is at most 10^−6.

Sample Input 1

1 1 7 2

Sample Output 1

3.0000000000

OBS:
As shown below, we can make the ball pass (7,2) 
by striking it aiming for (3,0).


Sample Input 2

1 1 3 2

Sample Output 2

1.6666666667

Sample Input 3

-9 99 -999 9999

Sample Output 3

-18.7058823529

The output will be considered correct when its absolute or relative error 
from our answer is at most 10^−6.
