Triangle Partitioning

You are given AB, AC and BC. DE is parallel to BC. 
You are also given the area ratio between ADE and BDEC. Y
ou have to find the value of AD.

Input

Input starts with an integer T (≤ 25), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case begins with four real numbers denoting AB, AC, BC and the ratio of ADE and BDEC (ADE / BDEC). 
You can safely assume that the given triangle is a valid triangle with positive area.

Output

For each case of input you have to print the case number and AD. Errors less than 10^-6 will be ignored.
