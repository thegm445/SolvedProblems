Crossed Ladders

A narrow street is lined with tall buildings. An x foot long ladder is rested 
at the base of the building on the right side of the street and leans on the building 
on the left side. A y foot long ladder is rested at the base of the building on the left 
side of the street and leans on the building on the right side. The point where the two 
ladders cross is exactly c feet from the ground. How wide is the street?
