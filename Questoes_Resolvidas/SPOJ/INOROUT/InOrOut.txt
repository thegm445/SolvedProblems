INOROUT - Inside or outside?

Given N points in counterclockwise order, which represent a convex polygon with 
N edges and N vertexes, you must answer Q queries, each of them represents one point. 
Use cross product to determine if the point is inside or outside the polygon.

Input

The first line contains 2 integers, N and Q, each of them lower than 10^3.

The second line has 2*N integers, with vales between -10^6 and 10^6, separated by 
a single space that represent the Xi and Yi coordinates of the i-th vertex of the polygon 
in counterclockwise order.

Format: X1 Y1 X2 Y2 ... XN YN

Next you will receive Q lines. Each line has two integers X and Y separated by 
space between -10^6 and 10^6 representing a query.

Note:

    It is guaranteed that the given polygon has no repeated vertices, but it may have collinear points.
    If a point lies on an edge of the polygon it must be considered inside the polygon.

Output

For each query (in the given order) print a single line that contains a letter 'D' 
if the point is inside the polygon or a letter 'F' if it's outside.
Example

Input:
3 3
0 0 3 0 0 3
-1 -1
0 0
1 1

Output:
F
D
D
